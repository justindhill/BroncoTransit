### A bus tracker for Western Michigan University

I am **not affiliated in any way with BroncoTransit**.

I built this app because I wanted to use a native app instead of the web app that BroncoTransit provides for Western Michigan University. Currently, it does the following things:

* Show where the buses are on their routes
* Switch between the buses
* Tell you where the closest bus stop is and how far it is from you
* Have a mediocre icon. Feel free to submit a pull request if you make one you like better.

I will be submitting this to the app store at some point with the blessing of BroncoTransit and after I have polished it up. Enjoy. :)
