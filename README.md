### A bus tracker for Western Michigan University that doesn't suck (as badly as the other option.)

I am **not affiliated in any way with BroncoTransit**.

I built this app because I was tired of using the (awful) web app that BroncoTransit provides for Western Michigan University. Currently, it does the following things:

* Show where the buses are on their routes
* Switch between the buses
* Have a mediocre icon. Feel free to submit a pull request if you make one you like better.

I will be submitting this to the app store at some point after it has received more than one night of my attention. Enjoy. :)
